# Quick Start Guide

Get the Live Shopping Platform running in 5 minutes!

## üõçÔ∏è What This Is

A **live shopping platform** for Shopify merchants (think QVC meets Instagram Live):

## Prerequisites Check

Before starting, ensure you have:
- ‚úÖ Node.js version 20 or higher
- ‚úÖ npm (comes with Node.js)

Check your versions:
```bash
node --version    # Should be v20.0.0 or higher
npm --version     # Should be 9.0.0 or higher
```

## Installation (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Navigate to project directory
```bash
cd d:/test
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

This will install:
- Remix framework
