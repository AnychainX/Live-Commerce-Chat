 * Represents a live shopping room with product information
 * 
 * @property videoUrl - HLS stream URL (NOTE: This is a TEMPLATE/DEMO URL. 
 *                      In production, sellers would provide their own live 
 *                      stream URL from a service like Mux)
 */
```

## üéØ Key Client Takeaways

### 1. Video Streaming is Template-Based
**Where it's documented:**
- README.md (prominent note at top + dedicated section)
- server.ts (inline comment at videoUrl default)
- VideoPlayer.tsx (component header)

**Client will understand:**
- This is intentional for testing
- Production requires streaming service integration
- Multiple options are available (Mux, AWS IVS, etc.)
- Exact steps to implement are provided

### 2. Code is Generously Commented
**Every major file includes:**
- Purpose explanation
- Feature list
- Technical details
- Production notes where applicable
- Inline comments for complex logic

**Benefits for client:**
- Easy to understand without developer explanation
- Clear path for future development
- Production considerations highlighted
- Shows professional development practices

### 3. Production Readiness Notes
**Throughout the codebase, comments highlight:**
- In-memory database limitations (need PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
- CORS settings need restriction (currently wildcard for dev)
- Template video needs replacement
- Static seller stats need database integration
- Error handling uses alerts (should use toast notifications)
