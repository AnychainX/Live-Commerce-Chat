# Live Shopping Platform - Shopify Live Commerce

A real-time live shopping platform built with **Remix**, **Socket.IO**, and **TypeScript**. Think **QVC meets Instagram Live** - merchants broadcast live video while showcasing products, and viewers can buy in real-time during the stream.

> **📹 NOTE ABOUT VIDEO STREAMING:** This demo uses a **template HLS video stream** for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, sellers would start their own live streams using services like Mux, AWS IVS, or similar platforms, and provide the HLS playback URL when creating a room. See the [Video Streaming Setup](#-video-streaming-setup) section for details.

## ✨ Features

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development servers (both Remix + Socket.IO)
npm run dev
```

This starts:
- **Remix** on http://localhost:3000 (frontend)
- **Socket.IO** on http://localhost:3001 (WebSocket backend)

### Using the Platform

#### As a Seller (Host)

1. **Open** http://localhost:3000
2. **Click** "Create Room" button
3. **Fill in**:
   - Room name (e.g., "Summer Fashion Collection")
   - Your name (host name)
   - Product name
   - Product description
   - Shopify URL (optional - defaults to shopify.com)
4. **Click** "Create Room & Go Live"
5. You're now the host! You can:
   - See the video player with product info
   - Moderate the chat (delete, ban, slow mode)
   - Send announcements
   - See viewer count

#### As a Buyer (Viewer)

1. **Open** http://localhost:3000
2. **Browse** available live rooms
3. **Click** on any room to join
4. **Enter** your username
5. You can now:
   - Watch the live video
   - Chat with other viewers and the host
   - Click "Buy Now on Shopify" to purchase

### Multi-Tab Testing

1. **Tab 1**: Create a room as host
2. **Tab 2**: Join the same room as a viewer
3. **Tab 3**: Join as another viewer
4. Chat messages sync instantly across all tabs!
5. Test moderation: host can delete/ban viewers

## 📹 Video Streaming Setup

### Current Demo Implementation

This project currently uses a **template/demo HLS video stream** for testing and demonstration purposes:

```typescript
// Default video URL in server.ts (line 293)
videoUrl: videoUrl || "https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8"
```

**This is intentional for the demo** to allow you to immediately test the platform without setting up a streaming service.

### Production Implementation

In a **real production environment**, here's how sellers would provide live video:

#### Option 1: Mux (Recommended)
1. **Seller starts a live stream:**
   - Sign up for [Mux](https://mux.com/)
   - Create a new "Live Stream" in Mux dashboard
   - Mux provides:
     - **RTMP URL** (for broadcasting software like OBS)
     - **HLS Playback URL** (for viewers to watch)

2. **Seller creates room with their stream:**
   ```typescript
   // When creating room, provide Mux playback URL
   videoUrl: "https://stream.mux.com/[PLAYBACK_ID].m3u8"
   ```

3. **Seller broadcasts:**
   - Use OBS, Streamlabs, or mobile app
   - Stream to the RTMP URL provided by Mux
   - Viewers watch via the HLS playback URL

#### Option 2: AWS IVS (Interactive Video Service)
1. Create an AWS IVS channel
2. Get the RTMP ingest endpoint and playback URL
3. Broadcast using streaming software
4. Provide playback URL when creating room

#### Option 3: Other Services
- **YouTube Live**: Use YouTube Live Stream API
- **Twitch**: Integrate Twitch embed player
- **Custom RTMP Server**: Self-hosted with Nginx-RTMP module

### How to Replace Template Video

To use real live streams, modify `server.ts`:

```typescript
// Before (Demo):
videoUrl: videoUrl || "https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8"

// After (Production):
videoUrl: videoUrl  // No default - require sellers to provide URL
// Or validate it's from your streaming service:
if (!videoUrl || !videoUrl.includes('your-streaming-service.com')) {
  throw new Error('Please provide a valid live stream URL');
}
```

### Technical Details

**HLS (HTTP Live Streaming):**
- Industry-standard protocol for adaptive bitrate streaming
- Works on all modern browsers via HLS.js library
- Automatically adjusts quality based on connection speed
- ~10-30 second latency (acceptable for live shopping)

**For Lower Latency:**
- Use WebRTC-based solutions (< 1 second latency)
- Services like Mux offer low-latency HLS (< 3 seconds)

**Current Video Player:**
- Located in: `app/components/VideoPlayer.tsx`
- Uses: HLS.js library for playback
- Supports: Custom controls, quality switching, error recovery

                                  (Check role, bans, slow mode)
                                       ↓
                                  Update Room Data
                                       ↓
                           Broadcast to All in Room
                                       ↓
